# TUCaN CTF A Guided Offensive Security Scenario

TUCaN CTF is a beginner-friendly Capture The Flag challenge simulating the TU Darmstadt student portal.

This project can serve as an introduction to offensive security concepts and Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges.  

A beginner-friendly walkthrough is available for those who want guided progression.

The entire environment is containerized and runs locally using Docker.

---

## Learning Objectives

This CTF introduces the following security concepts:

- Information disclosure  
- SQL injection  
- Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)  
- Authentication and authorization weaknesses  
- Port scanning and service enumeration  
- Weak password hashing  
- Linux privilege escalation  

---

## Scenario

A friend of yours claims to have achieved excellent academic results at TU Darmstadt but refuses to provide any proof.

Driven by curiosity, you decide to investigate and discover an online student portal named **TUCaN**.
